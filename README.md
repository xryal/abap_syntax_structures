I have established a repository titled 'ABAP Training' with the goal of comprehensively understanding the syntax structure and fundamental concepts of the Advanced Business Application Programming (ABAP) language. In this repository, I am diligently documenting key ABAP terms such as data types, internal tables, and function modules, while also providing examples to solidify my understanding of the language's intricacies.
